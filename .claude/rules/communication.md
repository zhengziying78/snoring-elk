# Communication Rules

## Clarity and Transparency
- **Clear Changes**: Be clear about what changes are being made
- **Clarification First**: Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous. Error on the safe side
- **Assumption Transparency**: If the code change is based on any assumption beyond what was explicitly stated, be very clear and transparent about the assumptions

## Best Practices
- Always explain the reasoning behind implementation choices
- When proposing changes, clearly state the benefits and potential risks
- If multiple approaches are possible, explain the trade-offs
- Be explicit about any dependencies or side effects of proposed changes
